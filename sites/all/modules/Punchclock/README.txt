To set up:


  1. Enable punchclock module and dependancies
  2. admin/structure/taxonomy/punchclock_activities and add project codes (Each shift is tagged with a taxonomy term)

  3. admin/people/permissions and set permissions for Punchclock module, the punchclock taxonomy, and field_punch_* field permissions

  4. Give the appropriate supervisors/employees their respective roles, giving them first and last names as well (if you don't want to use the first and last names as provided in this module, you will have to edit the views to pull the appropriate name fields)
  5. Enable the "Punch block" and "Vew: Punchclock Status: Punched In" blocks
